# MarketObserver
Collection of usful tools for eve online

(!) The initial commit is NOT what is currently in production

General Idea:
- Wrap a login/logout button to the marketobserver to enable further personalized features (like mining ledger, assign alts to mains, ...)

Current state:
- Login / Logout working (with spring sessions)
- Data endpoint for data for frontend is not available in initial commit

Biggest issue to solve:
- Use autogenerated API client to interact with the SSO from the login, so that the accesstoken gets autorefreshed if needed
- Use generated MarketApi to retrieve list of orders (only example needed, logic is already exitinng from previous version)
- Get generated http client to cache requests locally , in accorande to the header infos (i.e. 30min, ...)
- reduce existing code to the minimum to allow me to understand it :)

Nice to have:
- Beautify frontend - align frames/boxes
- Refactor frontend to have a common nav bar and allow new sub pages in the furure
- refactor to JWT?
